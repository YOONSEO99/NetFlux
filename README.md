## 🎯 Project Goals & Mission

### **Mission**
To empower network administrators with an intuitive, real-time visualization tool that bridges the gap between raw network data and human-centric monitoring.

### **Key Objectives**
* **Centralized Monitoring:** Consolidate status data from various network devices into a single unified view.
* **Visual Clarity:** Transform abstract network logs into an interactive topology map for faster troubleshooting.
* **Reactive Architecture:** Utilize **Angular** and **RxJS** to handle asynchronous data streams with high responsiveness.
